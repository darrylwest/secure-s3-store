# AI Partner Programming Preferences

Here is a list of programming preferences that I would like to be aware of...

* projects that start from scratch are first **proof-of-concept** so although we will need unit tests, it's best to wait until the proof is realistic.
* we will need a way to test the proof of concept, so we need e2e scripts that can be run manually, then possibly automated
* we always use lint and prettier to enforce our coding style
* versioning is important to our company.  we need to log the version (either to console or rolling file logger) at the start of a new session
